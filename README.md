# 2-DOF Planar Robotic Arm: Kinematics & Path Following (MATLAB)

This project simulates and visualizes the movement of a 2-Degree-of-Freedom (2-DOF) planar robotic arm. It demonstrates the implementation of both **Forward Kinematics (FK)** and **Inverse Kinematics (IK)** to enable the arm to follow arbitrary paths within its workspace.

The simulation provides a clear visual representation of how a robot translates joint angles into end-effector positions (FK) and, more importantly, how it determines the necessary joint angles to reach a desired target position (IK).

## Features

* **Forward Kinematics:** Calculates the end-effector's (X, Y) coordinates given the joint angles (Î¸1, Î¸2).
* **Inverse Kinematics:** Solves for the joint angles (Î¸1, Î¸2) required to reach a specified (X, Y) target coordinate.
    * Handles **reachability checks** (determines if a target is within the arm's physical limits).
    * Manages **multiple solutions** for IK (e.g., "elbow-up" vs. "elbow-down" configurations).
* **Dynamic Path Following:** Animates the robotic arm as it attempts to follow a series of randomly generated target points.
* **Trajectory Trace:** Plots the actual path traced by the end-effector during the animation.
* **Interactive Visualization:** Real-time graphical updates of the arm's links, joints, end-effector, and current target.
* **Modular Code:** Separates the core IK logic into a dedicated function (`solve_ik_2dof.m`).

## How It Works

The project leverages fundamental principles of robotic kinematics:

1.  **System Definition:** A 2-DOF planar arm is defined by its two link lengths (L1, L2) and two revolute joint angles (Î¸1, Î¸2).
2.  **Forward Kinematics (FK):** Uses basic trigonometry (sine and cosine functions) to compute the end-effector's position from the given joint angles.
    * `x_EE = L1 * cos(Î¸1) + L2 * cos(Î¸1 + Î¸2)`
    * `y_EE = L1 * sin(Î¸1) + L2 * sin(Î¸1 + Î¸2)`
3.  **Inverse Kinematics (IK):** Solves the inverse problem using a **geometric approach** (Law of Cosines and `atan2` function) to determine the joint angles required for a given end-effector position. It yields two possible solutions for most points in the workspace.
4.  **Path Generation:** A series of random (X, Y) coordinates are generated within a defined safe region of the arm's workspace to create a dynamic path.
5.  **Animation Loop:** For each point in the generated path:
    * The IK solver determines the necessary joint angles.
    * The arm's graphical representation is updated on the plot using `set()` commands.
    * A small `pause()` is introduced to control animation speed.
    * The end-effector's trace is continuously drawn.
